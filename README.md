**Amana** is a decentralized escrow protocol designed to secure agricultural trade across different regions. By leveraging **Soroban Smart Contracts**, Amana eliminates the "Trust Gap" between buyers and sellers, ensuring fair trade even when parties are hundreds of miles apart.

## 🚀 The Mission

To provide a programmable safety net for regional commodity trading. Amana ensures that the risk of "sending first" is eliminated, replaced by a secure, neutral vault that only releases funds when delivery is verified.

## 🛠 Features

- **Smart Escrow:** Secure funds holding using cNGN/stablecoins on the Stellar network.
- **Dynamic Loss Sharing:** Negotiable risk-sharing ratios (e.g., 50/50, 70/30) hardcoded into every trade to handle transit accidents or theft.
- **Proof-of-Delivery (PoD):** A mandatory video-based verification protocol involving the buyer and the driver to confirm the state of goods.
- **Volatility Protection:** Utilizes Stellar Path Payments to allow users to pay in local currency (NGN) while locking value in cNGN.
- **Automated Settlement:** A flat 1% platform fee is automatically deducted upon successful trade completion.

## 🏗 Technical Stack

- **Frontend:** [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (App Router)
- **Smart Contracts:** [Soroban](https://soroban.stellar.org/) (Rust)
- **Blockchain:** [Stellar Network](https://www.stellar.org/)
- **Wallet Connection:** [Freighter](https://www.freighter.app/) / [Albedo](https://albedo.link/)
- **Storage:** IPFS (via Pinata) for decentralized storage of video evidence.
- **Database:** Supabase (Off-chain metadata, driver logs, and user profiles).
- **Observability:** OpenTelemetry distributed tracing with correlation IDs for end-to-end request tracking.

## 🧪 Local Environments (Folder-Based)

- `frontend/` → Next.js app environment (UI + wallet + Supabase/Pinata client integration)
- `backend/` → Node.js/TypeScript API environment (Supabase + Pinata + integration endpoints)
- `contracts/` → Rust/Soroban smart contract environment

### Frontend setup

The frontend has been moved to the separate repository: `Amana-Frontend/`.

1. `cd Amana-Frontend`
2. `cp .env.example .env.local`
3. `npm install`
4. `npm run dev`

### Backend setup

The backend has been moved to the separate repository: `Amana-backend-service/`.

1. `cd Amana-backend-service`
2. `cp .env.example .env`
3. `cp .env.tracing.example .env.tracing` (for distributed tracing configuration)
4. `npm install`
5. `npm run dev`

### Backend API docs

- Source of truth: `Amana-backend-service/src/docs/openapi.yaml`
- Dev Swagger UI: `http://localhost:4000/api/docs`
- JSON export: `http://localhost:4000/api/docs/openapi.json`

The backend writes `Amana-backend-service/src/docs/openapi.json` from the YAML spec in non-production runs so reviewers can inspect either format.

### Contracts setup

1. `cd contracts/amana_escrow`
2. `cargo build`

## 🔒 Required PR CI Gates

Amana enforces stack-level CI gates on pull requests through `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

- **Frontend Required Gate**: `npm ci`, `npm run lint`, `npm run build` in `Amana-Frontend/`
- **Backend Required Gate**: `npm ci`, `npm run build`, `npm test` in `Amana-backend-service/`
- **Contracts Required Gate**: `cargo test` in `contracts/amana_escrow/`

Path-aware execution is enabled to avoid unnecessary runtime. If a stack has no changed files, the gate reports a skip-note and passes.

### Branch protection setup (GitHub)

For the protected branch (`main`), set these required status checks:

- `Frontend Required Gate`
- `Backend Required Gate`
- `Contracts Required Gate`

## 🔄 How It Works (The Amana Flow)

1. **Initiate:** The Seller lists products. The Buyer initiates a trade, depositing funds that are converted to cNGN via a Stellar Path Payment.
2. **Lock:** The Smart Contract locks the funds and stores the agreed-upon `Loss_Ratio`.
3. **Dispatch:** The Seller provides the driver's name, phone number, and vehicle manifest.
4. **Verification:** - **Success:** Buyer receives goods and uploads a confirmation video. Funds release to Seller.
   - **Dispute:** Buyer uploads a video of loss/damage with driver affirmation. A mediator reviews the evidence.
5. **Settlement:** Based on the outcome, funds are distributed (either 100% to one party or split via the `Loss_Ratio`).

## 🗺 Roadmap

### Phase 1: The Vault (MVP)

- [ ] Develop core Soroban contract logic (`deposit`, `release`, `refund`).
- [ ] Implement basic Next.js UI for trade creation.

### Phase 2: The Agreement Engine

- [ ] Integrate `Loss_Ratio` variables into the smart contract.
- [ ] Build the "Mediator" dashboard for dispute resolution.

### Phase 3: Evidence & Logistics

- [ ] IPFS integration for video evidence uploads.
- [ ] Driver manifest logging and tracking interface.

### Phase 4: Mainnet & Scale

- [ ] Public pilot program with regional agricultural cooperatives.
- [ ] Implementation of a "Trust Score" reputation system.

## 🔍 Distributed Tracing

Amana includes comprehensive distributed tracing with OpenTelemetry for end-to-end request visibility and faster incident triage.

### Features

- **Correlation IDs**: Unique identifiers spanning frontend-backend requests
- **Request Tracing**: Complete request lifecycle tracking
- **Service Integration**: Automatic tracing for external services (IPFS, Stellar)
- **Observability**: Jaeger, Zipkin, and Prometheus integration

### Quick Start

1. Configure tracing environment variables (see `backend/.env.tracing.example`)
2. Start Jaeger for trace visualization: `docker run -p 16686:16686 jaegertracing/all-in-one`
3. View traces at `http://localhost:16686`
4. Check metrics at `http://localhost:9464/metrics`

### Documentation

See [DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_GUIDE.md](./DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_GUIDE.md) for detailed setup and usage instructions.
